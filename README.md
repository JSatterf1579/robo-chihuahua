## Implementation of Taco Bell's ordering API

A simple implemenation of Taco Bell's API for online orders.
Requires the [Request](https://github.com/request/request) library.

Since there's no publicly available documentation for the API, and really no acknowledgement
of it at all, I can't guarentee that everything won't break some day.

## Current features
* Log in to a user's account
* Lookup user and order information
* Recreate a previously placed order
* Change the store used for ordering
* Complete and pay for an order (using a new credit card)

## Planned features
* Create a new order from scratch
* Add items to orders
* Get lists of menu items and store locations
* Using previously stored payment info for orders
